# Bloxide Spec Directory

This directory is the single source of truth for all architecture decisions, state machine designs, and blox contracts. Write the spec before writing code.

> **NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.** This project does not preserve backwards
> compatibility — not for APIs, CLIs, config formats, terminology, or
> architecture layers. When something changes, update every call site, every
> doc, and every fixture in the same change, and delete the old form
> completely. Never add legacy aliases, deprecation periods, compatibility
> shims, feature bridges, or "kept for backwards compatibility" notes.

## Recommended Reading Order (New Blox Authors)

When you are new to the codebase, this order minimizes context-switching:

1. [architecture/00-layered-architecture.md](architecture/00-layered-architecture.md)
2. [architecture/01-hsm-engine.md](architecture/01-hsm-engine.md)
3. [architecture/11-action-crate-pattern.md](architecture/11-action-crate-pattern.md)
4. [architecture/04-handler-patterns.md](architecture/04-handler-patterns.md)
5. [architecture/05-actions.md](architecture/05-actions.md)
6. [architecture/08-application.md](architecture/08-application.md)

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

```
1. Spec     →  Write / update the relevant doc in this directory
2. Review   →  Verify diagrams, transition tables, and acceptance criteria
3. Test     →  Write tests against the acceptance criteria using TestRuntime
4. Implement → Write the Rust code to pass the tests
5. Sync     →  Update diagrams here if implementation reveals spec errors
```

The spec is always ahead of or equal to the code. Never let code drift silently from the spec.

## Creating a New Blox

1. Copy `spec/templates/blox-spec.md` → `spec/bloxes/<your-blox-name>.md`
2. Fill in every section (delete the instructional blockquotes as you go)
3. Get the spec reviewed before creating any Rust code
4. Create the pure-TOML blox source at `bloxes/<your-blox-name>/` (`blox.toml`; `cargo blox new` scaffolds this), and when needed real crates under `crates/`: `crates/messages/<your-blox-name>-messages/`, `crates/context/blox-ctx-<name>/` (action functions), and — only for runtime-specific behavior such as spawn factories — an impl crate such as `crates/impl/<name>-impl/` consumed by the wiring binary
5. Write integration tests at `bloxes/<your-blox-name>/tests/<your-blox-name>.rs` using `TestRuntime`, one test per acceptance criterion
6. Run `cargo blox generate` to materialize the crate into `target/bloxide-generated/`, then implement action functions to make the tests pass
7. Add wiring in an example's `examples/<name>/system.toml`

## Key Invariants

These retained architecture invariants define the library boundaries:

- `bloxide-core` must compile under `no_std` with zero OS or executor imports
- Blox crates must be generic over `R: BloxRuntime`; never import a runtime crate
- Message enums must contain plain data only — no `ActorRef`, no runtime receiver handles
- Shared message types live in a dedicated `*-messages` crate, not inside either blox crate
- `on_entry` and `on_exit` are `fn(&mut Ctx)` — infallible, no `Result`
- Only leaf states may be transition targets
