# Actor Messaging

Actors communicate exclusively through typed mailboxes. No shared mutable state; no raw channels in domain code.

## Core Types

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ActorId {
        <<type alias>>
        usize
    }

    class Envelope~M~ {
        +.0: ActorId
        +.1: M
    }

    class ActorRef~M_R~ {
        -id: ActorId
        -tx: RuntimeSender
        +id() ActorId
        +async send(from, payload) Result
        +try_send(from, payload) Result
        +sender() RuntimeSender
        +clone() ActorRef
    }

    ActorRef --> ActorId : identifies
    Envelope --> ActorId : from field
```

- `ActorRef<M, R>` is `Clone + Send + Sync`. Hand it to any state that needs to send a message to that actor.
- `send` awaits mailbox capacity (async, backpressure).
- `try_send` returns an error immediately if the mailbox is full or closed (non-blocking, preferred in `actions` / `on_entry`). Distinguish the two failure kinds with `BloxRuntime::try_send_error_is_closed`: full is genuine backpressure (worth a warning); closed means the receiving task is gone — an expected shutdown race, handled as a silent no-op.
- `sender()` returns the underlying `R::Sender<M>` (a clone of the internal sender). Used by the wiring layer to hand a raw sender to a `ChildGroup` without wrapping it in an `ActorRef`.
- `Envelope` wraps every message with the sender's `ActorId` so recipients know who sent it.

## Message Flow Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph PingActor
        PingCtx[PingCtx\nholds pong_ref]
        PingSM[StateMachine]
    end

    subgraph PongActor
        PongCtx[PongCtx\nholds ping_ref]
        PongSM[StateMachine]
    end

    subgraph Mailboxes
        PM[Ping Mailbox\nActorRef&lt;PingPongMsg&gt;]
        OM[Pong Mailbox\nActorRef&lt;PingPongMsg&gt;]
    end

    PingCtx -- try_send --> OM
    PongCtx -- try_send --> PM
    PM -- Envelope --> PingSM
    OM -- Envelope --> PongSM
```

## Ping-Pong Message Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Wiring / Runtime
    participant Ping
    participant Pong

    W->>Ping: dispatch(LifecycleCommand::Start)
    W->>Pong: dispatch(LifecycleCommand::Start)

    Note over Ping: Init → Operating → Active<br/>(on_entry: send_initial_ping, round 0→1)
    Note over Pong: Init → Ready

    Ping->>Pong: PingPongMsg::Ping(1)
    Note over Pong: Ready — Decision::Stay<br/>sends Pong(1)
    Pong->>Ping: PingPongMsg::Pong(1)
    Note over Ping: Active — stay, no self-transition<br/>(round=2, forwards Ping(2));<br/>round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND → Paused

    Ping->>Pong: PingPongMsg::Ping(2)
    Note over Ping: Paused — on_entry schedules resume timer<br/>(2000 + round × 500 ms)
    Ping->>Ping: PingPongMsg::Resume (timer fires)
    Note over Ping: Paused → Active<br/>(round=3, forwards Ping(3))

    Ping->>Pong: PingPongMsg::Ping(3)
    Pong->>Ping: PingPongMsg::Pong(3)
    Note over Ping: Active — stay (round=4, forwards Ping(4))

    Note over Ping,Pong: ... round 4 ...

    Ping->>Pong: PingPongMsg::Ping(5)
    Note over Ping: Decision::Done<br/>(round >= MAX_ROUNDS, clean self-termination)
    Pong->>Ping: PingPongMsg::Pong(5)
    Note over Ping: task ended — Pong(5) not consumed
```

## Rules

### No receivers in domain messages

Domain message enums must be plain data. Never embed runtime receiver handles, raw senders, or `ActorRef` inside a message payload. All wiring is done at construction time through `Ctx`.

```rust
// WRONG — leaks runtime internals into the message
enum MyEvent {
    Subscribe(ActorRef<Response, R>),  // ← never do this
}

// RIGHT — put the ActorRef in Ctx at construction time
pub struct MyCtx<R: BloxRuntime> {
    pub subscriber_ref: ActorRef<Response, R>,
}
```

### Message types in separate crates

Message types shared between two blox crates live in a dedicated `*-messages` crate. This prevents circular crate dependencies and makes the message contract explicit and independently versioned.

```
ping-pong-messages/   ← owned by neither ping nor pong
  src/lib.rs          ← pub enum PingPongMsg { Ping(...), Pong(...), Resume(...) }
```

### Fanout

To send the same event to multiple actors, store `Arc<Payload>` inside the event variant so cloning is O(1). Clone `ActorRef` for each recipient.

## Backpressure Policy

| Method | Behavior when mailbox is full |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `ActorRef::send` | Awaits until space is available |
| `ActorRef::try_send` | Returns `TrySendError` immediately |

Use `try_send` from `on_entry` and `actions` functions (which run synchronously inside dispatch). Reserve `send` for async contexts outside the machine (e.g., the actor run loop or wiring).

## Channel Close Semantics (all-streams-close, issue #134)

A channel closes when every sender (`ActorRef`) for it has been dropped.
Domain mailbox closes are a **garbage-collection backstop, not a lifecycle
signal**: actor fate is owned exclusively by supervision — dispatch-driven
lifecycle commands (`Start`/`Reset`/`Stop`), `Decision::Stop`/`Decision::Done`,
and the kill capability.

**`Mailboxes` behavior:** The blanket tuple impls in `mailboxes.rs`
(`poll_next` returns `Poll<Option<E>>`) return `Poll::Ready(None)` only when
**every** stream in the tuple has closed —
i.e. no domain sender remains anywhere, so the actor cannot be reached at
all. A single closed stream does **not** shut down the actor: a peer
dropping its `ActorRef` merely removes one input. The run loop polls the
lifecycle/abort streams separately, and a close on **those** streams is
immediately fatal (shutdown flows through them).

**Streams must be fused:** once a stream returns `Poll::Ready(None)` it must
keep returning `Poll::Ready(None)` on re-poll. All bloxide runtime channel
receivers satisfy this.

**Consequence for self-refs:** an actor holding its own `self_ref` keeps its
domain stream open forever — harmless, because shutdown flows through the
lifecycle stream, not domain close. Actors that finish their work should
use `Decision::Done` (clean self-termination, task ends) rather than relying
on close semantics.

**For runtimes:** no special handling is required beyond fused receivers.
Dynamic teardown (stopped workers, removed peers) goes through the explicit
supervision path — Stop/Kill and deregistration — never implicit ref-drop.
