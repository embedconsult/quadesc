# Actions: Free Functions in Context Crates

Bloxide uses a composition model where a blox is assembled from reusable building blocks — **messages**, **context crates** (which include action functions), and **state machine logic**. This keeps each concern in its own crate and ensures the blox itself contains no platform-specific code or logic.

The **blox declares what actions to call** via `[[context.actions]]` entries in `blox.toml`, but does not contain the action logic. The system codegen resolves the action functions from context crates or impl crates and inlines them into the generated `Spec`.

## Action Functions

Action functions are **free functions** in context crates (or impl crates for impl-specific behavior). They take **concrete params** extracted from the context struct, not trait-bounded `&mut C` references.

### Function signatures by use site

The use site — where the action is wired in the topology — determines the closure signature the codegen generates:

| Use site | Closure signature | When called |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `[[topology.entry]]` | `fn(&mut Ctx) -> ()` | State entry (infallible) |
| `[[topology.exit]]` | `fn(&mut Ctx) -> ()` | State exit (infallible) |
| `[[topology.transitions]]` `actions` | `fn(&mut Ctx, &Event) -> ActionResult` | Transition rule action |

**Uniform contract.** A transition action function returns `ActionResult`,
`Result<(), E>`, or `()` — send failures become `ActionResult::from(result)`.
The generated transition wrapper normalizes the function's result via
`::bloxide_core::transition::ActionResult::from(...)`. When the rule declares
`event_payload` and the incoming event's payload does not match, the wrapper is
a no-op returning `ActionResult::Ok`. Entry/exit functions are infallible
(`fn(&mut Ctx)`); the generated wrapper is `|ctx| { the_fn(args); }` and
discards any return value.

### Example: context crate action function

```rust
// crates/context/blox-ctx-rounds/src/lib.rs
pub fn increment_round(round: &mut u32) -> ActionResult {
    *round += 1;
    ActionResult::Ok
}
```

```rust
// crates/context/blox-ctx-ping-pong/src/lib.rs
pub fn send_ping<R: BloxRuntime>(
    self_id: ActorId,
    peer_ref: &ActorRef<PingPongMsg, R>,
    round: u32,
) -> ActionResult {
    ActionResult::from(peer_ref.try_send(self_id, PingPongMsg::Ping(Ping { round })))
}
```

### Example: impl crate action function

```rust
// crates/impl/tokio-pool-demo-impl/src/lib.rs
pub fn process_work(task_id: &mut u32, result: &mut u32, do_work: &DoWork) -> ActionResult {
    *task_id = do_work.task_id;
    *result = do_work.task_id * 2;
    ActionResult::Ok
}
```

### Action declaration in `blox.toml`

```toml
[[context.actions]]
name = "increment_round"
crate = "blox_ctx_rounds"
fields = ["round:mut"]
impl_required = false

[[context.actions]]
name = "send_initial_ping"
crate = "blox_ctx_ping_pong"
fields = ["self_id", "peer_ref:ref", "round:mut"]
impl_required = false

[[context.actions]]
name = "process_work"
fields = ["task_id:mut", "result:mut"]
event_payload = "do_work"
impl_required = true
```

The logical `name` can differ from the called function via `fn_name` (e.g.
ping's `forward_ping` calls `blox_ctx_ping_pong::send_ping`), and `module`
inserts a module segment (e.g. `module = "actions"` →
`bloxide_timer::actions::cancel_timer_by_id`). Unknown TOML keys are hard
errors (`deny_unknown_fields`) — a stale `kind` key is rejected the same way.

### Field access modes

Each field in the `fields` list has an access mode suffix:

| Suffix | Meaning | Generated code |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `:mut` | Mutable borrow | `&mut ctx.field` |
| `:ref` | Immutable borrow | `&ctx.field` |
| (none) | Copy/owned | `ctx.field` (e.g. `ctx.self_id` for `ActorId`) |

### `event_payload` extraction

When `event_payload` is set, the codegen wraps the action call in an event destructuring. The matched arm returns the function's `ActionResult` verbatim; a non-matching payload is a no-op `Ok`:

```rust
// Generated closure for "process_work" with event_payload = "do_work"
|ctx, ev| {
    if let Some(WorkerMsg::DoWork(do_work)) = ev.msg_payload() {
        ::tokio_pool_demo_impl::process_work(&mut ctx.task_id, &mut ctx.result, do_work)
    } else {
        ::bloxide_core::transition::ActionResult::Ok
    }
}
```

## Two-Stage Codegen

### Stage 1 — Blox-level (`cargo blox generate`)

Generates **stub action closures** (no-op) with **real guards**. The stub body
carries the action name in a `let _stub = "...";` marker; transition stubs
additionally return `ActionResult::Ok`. The blox compiles standalone without
any impl dependency.

```rust
// generated/spec_skeleton.rs — stub actions, REAL guards
impl<R: BloxRuntime> PingSpec<R> {
    const ACTIVE_FNS: StateFns<Self> = StateFns {
        on_entry: &[
            |_ctx| { let _stub = "send_initial_ping"; },
        ],
        transitions: &[StateRule {
            matches: |ev| ev.msg_payload()
                .is_some_and(|m| matches!(m, PingPongMsg::Pong(_))),
            actions: &[
                |_ctx, _ev| { let _stub = "increment_round"; ActionResult::Ok },
                |_ctx, _ev| { let _stub = "forward_ping"; ActionResult::Ok },
            ],
            // REAL guard — direct field access, no B, no trait methods
            guard: |ctx, results, _ev| {
                if results.any_failed() { Decision::Transition(LeafState::new(PingState::Error)) }
                else if ctx.round >= MAX_ROUNDS as u32 { Decision::Done }
                else if ctx.round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND as u32 { Decision::Transition(LeafState::new(PingState::Paused)) }
                else { Decision::Stay }
            },
        }],
    };
}
```

### Stage 2 — System-level (system.toml pass of `cargo blox generate`)

The same `cargo blox generate` run (also triggered by `cargo blox build` /
`check` / `test` / `run`) then processes every `system.toml`: it resolves
context/impl crates and generates **concrete action closures** with real,
fully-qualified function calls into the materialized example crate's
`src/generated/` (under `target/bloxide-generated/examples/`). Guards are
unchanged from blox-level (already real). Before emitting anything,
`validate_concrete_actions` hard-fails on any `Self::` action that is not
declared in `[[context.actions]]` or has no resolvable crate (or no `impl_crate`
for `impl_required = true`) — there are no placeholder fallbacks.

```rust
// target/bloxide-generated/examples/<app>/src/generated/ping_spec_skeleton.rs — concrete, context fns inlined
impl<R: BloxRuntime> PingSpec<R> {
    const ACTIVE_FNS: StateFns<Self> = StateFns {
        on_entry: &[
            |ctx| { ::blox_ctx_ping_pong::send_initial_ping(ctx.self_id, &ctx.peer_ref, &mut ctx.round); },
        ],
        transitions: &[StateRule {
            matches: |ev| ev.msg_payload()
                .is_some_and(|m| matches!(m, PingPongMsg::Pong(_))),
            actions: &[
                // fn result normalized via ActionResult::from(...)
                |ctx, _ev| { ::bloxide_core::transition::ActionResult::from(::blox_ctx_rounds::increment_round(&mut ctx.round)) },
                // forward_ping → send_ping via fn_name
                |ctx, _ev| { ::blox_ctx_ping_pong::send_ping(ctx.self_id, &ctx.peer_ref, ctx.round) },
            ],
            guard: |ctx, results, _ev| {  // same as blox-level
                if results.any_failed() { Decision::Transition(LeafState::new(PingState::Error)) }
                else if ctx.round >= MAX_ROUNDS as u32 { Decision::Done }
                else if ctx.round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND as u32 { Decision::Transition(LeafState::new(PingState::Paused)) }
                else { Decision::Stay }
            },
        }],
    };
}
```

## Guards

Guards are the `guard` function in a `TransitionRule` — a pure `fn(&Ctx, &ActionResults, &Event) -> Decision<S>`. The engine calls `guard(ctx, results, event)` after running all actions. Guards receive the collected action results and the event, plus read-only access to context (the borrow checker prevents mutation). The returned `Decision<S>` is one of `Transition(LeafState)` / `Stay` / `Reset` / `Stop` / `Done` / `Fail`; guards can inspect `ActionResults` to react to action failures (e.g. send errors).

**`ActionResult` vs `ActionResults`**: Each action returns `ActionResult` (Ok/Err). The engine collects all results into `ActionResults` before calling the guard. Guards receive `&ActionResults` to inspect `any_failed()`, `all_ok()`, and `failure_count()`.

### Guard expression translation

Guards in `blox.toml` are pure expressions over ctx fields and `ActionResults`. The blox-level codegen translates them to direct field access:

| `blox.toml` expression | Generated Rust |
|---|---|
| `ctx.round >= MAX_ROUNDS as u32` | `ctx.round >= MAX_ROUNDS as u32` (direct field access) |
| `ctx.round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND as u32` | `ctx.round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND as u32` |
| `ctx.pending == 0` | `ctx.pending == 0` |
| `results.any_failed()` | `results.any_failed()` (unchanged — method on `ActionResults`) |

The codegen parser:
1. Leaves `ctx.field` direct field access unchanged (already correct)
2. Leaves `results.*()` calls unchanged (they're methods on `ActionResults`)
3. Leaves boolean operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) unchanged

### Declarative form (`[[topology.transitions]]` in `blox.toml`)

Transition rules are declared as `[[topology.transitions]]` entries in `blox.toml`. The codegen builds `StateRule` struct literals from these entries. Actions are specified as a list of action names — `actions = ["Self::increment_round", "Self::forward_ping"]`. The action function bodies are resolved from context/impl crates by the system codegen.

```toml
# Actions + conditional guards (fall-through: target = "stay")
[[topology.transitions]]
state = "Active"
event = "PingPongMsg::Pong(_)"
target = "stay"
actions = ["Self::increment_round", "Self::forward_ping"]

  [[topology.transitions.guards]]
  condition = "results.any_failed()"
  target = "Error"

  [[topology.transitions.guards]]
  condition = "ctx.round >= MAX_ROUNDS as u32"
  target = "done"

  [[topology.transitions.guards]]
  condition = "ctx.round == PAUSE_AT_ROUND as u32"
  target = "Paused"

# Counter: actions then guard — done at DONE_AT_COUNT, else stay
[[topology.transitions]]
state = "Ready"
event = "CounterMsg::Tick(_)"
target = "stay"
actions = ["Self::count_tick"]

  [[topology.transitions.guards]]
  condition = "ctx.count >= DONE_AT_COUNT"
  target = "done"

  [[topology.transitions.guards]]
  condition = "_"
  target = "stay"
```

Guard targets are evaluated in declaration order; the first matching
`condition` wins, and when none match the rule's own `target` is the
fall-through. Target vocabulary: `"stay"` / `"reset"` / `"stop"` / `"done"` /
`"fail"` map to the corresponding `Decision` variants; any other value is a
state name and becomes `Decision::Transition(LeafState::new(State))`.

The execution order is engine-defined: actions always run before the guard, regardless of how the arm is visually arranged.

**Event pattern shorthand:**
- **`*Msg`** — patterns on types ending in `Msg` (e.g. `PingPongMsg::Ping(ping)`) use `msg_payload()` for matching.
- **`*Ctrl`** — patterns on types ending in `Ctrl` (e.g. `PeerCtrl::AddPeer(p)`) use `ctrl_payload()` for matching; the action receives the whole `PeerCtrl` value.
- **Event-variant** — patterns starting with the event enum's own name (e.g. `PoolEvent::SpawnReply(_)`) use the per-mailbox payload accessor (e.g. `ev.spawn_reply_payload()`).

## Logging

Logging has been **ripped out of blox crates**. All `bloxide-log` usage has been removed from blox crates. The `bloxide-log` crate stays in place for runtime/context crate usage. Domain-level logging re-design is a deferred decision.

The crate surface is five macros — `blox_log_trace!`, `blox_log_debug!`,
`blox_log_info!`, `blox_log_warn!`, `blox_log_error!` — each taking the actor
id as first argument. Backend gating: `defmt` wins over `log`; with neither
feature the macros expand to no-ops (use a string literal as the format
argument — `defmt` requires it).

Never add `blox_log_*!` calls to blox crates or add `bloxide-log` as a dependency of a blox crate.

## Rules

- Action functions live in **context crates** (free functions) or **impl crates** (impl-specific behavior).
- Action functions take **concrete params** extracted from context fields, not trait-bounded `&mut C` references.
- Transition action functions return `ActionResult`, `Result<(), E>`, or `()`; the generated wrapper normalizes the result via `ActionResult::from(...)`. Entry/exit functions are infallible.
- Context crates must not import Embassy, Tokio, file I/O, or executor-specific code.
- Blox crates contain zero logic — no `actions.rs`, no `Self::` methods, no logging, no computation.
- The use site (transition vs entry/exit slot) determines the closure signature the codegen generates. A stale `kind` key is a hard parse error (`deny_unknown_fields`).
- `role` in `[[context.uses]]` is validated — only `"ctor"` (constructor parameter) or `"state"` (zero-initialized field). Unknown TOML keys anywhere are hard errors.
- Guards are pure field comparisons generated at the blox level — they don't depend on impl crates.
