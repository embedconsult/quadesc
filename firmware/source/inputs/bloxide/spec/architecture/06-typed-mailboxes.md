# Typed Mailboxes

Each actor has **one mailbox per message type it can receive**. The run loop selects
across all mailboxes in priority order, converting each incoming envelope into the
actor's unified `Event` enum before dispatching through the HSM.

## Motivation

A single untyped mailbox would require the `Event` enum to be the shared message type,
making all callers aware of the full event space. Typed per-message mailboxes give each
sender a precise `ActorRef<M, R>` handle — they can only send the message types they
are authorized to send.

## The `Mailboxes` Trait

```rust
pub trait Mailboxes<E: Send + 'static>: Send + 'static + Unpin {
    /// Poll all mailboxes in priority order (index 0 = highest priority).
    /// Returns the next event converted into the unified `E` type, or
    /// `Poll::Ready(None)` once **every** stream in the tuple has closed
    /// (all-streams-close semantics, issue #134).
    fn poll_next(&mut self, cx: &mut core::task::Context<'_>) -> core::task::Poll<Option<E>>;
}
```

Blanket implementations are generated at build time by bloxide-core's `build.rs` (via
`bloxide-codegen`, from the `[mailboxes]` section of `blox.toml`) into
`$OUT_DIR/mailboxes_impls.rs` for 1- through 16-element tuples where each element `Si`
implements `Stream<Item = Ti>` and `E: From<Ti>`.

## Actor Event Enum

Every actor defines a unified `Event` enum with one variant per mailbox. Each variant
wraps the full `Envelope<M>` so the handler can inspect the sender's `ActorId`.

```toml
# In blox.toml
[event]
name = "PingEvent"

[[event.mailboxes]]
variant = "Msg"
message = "PingPongMsg"
message_path = "ping_pong_messages::PingPongMsg"
```

Run `cargo blox generate` to produce `src/generated/events.rs` (in the materialized crate under `target/bloxide-generated/`) with `From<Envelope<M>>` impls,
`EventTag`, tag constants, and payload accessor methods. Then use `pub use crate::generated::events::*;`.

## `MachineSpec::Mailboxes<R>` Associated Type

Every `MachineSpec` implementation declares its mailbox tuple via a generic associated
type (GAT), using `R: BloxRuntime` to produce the concrete stream types:

```rust
pub trait MachineSpec: Sized + 'static {
    // ...existing associated types...

    /// Declares the set of typed mailbox streams for this actor.
    /// Streams are polled in index order — index 0 has highest priority.
    type Mailboxes<R: BloxRuntime>: Mailboxes<Self::Event>;
}
```

Example for the Ping blox:

```rust
impl<R: BloxRuntime> MachineSpec for PingSpec<R> {
    type Event = PingEvent;
    type Mailboxes<Rt: BloxRuntime> = (Rt::Stream<PingPongMsg>,);
    // ...
}
```

Actors that are only driven directly (e.g., in unit tests) use `NoMailboxes`:

```rust
type Mailboxes<R: BloxRuntime> = NoMailboxes;
```

## Lifecycle and the Runtime

**Lifecycle is not a domain mailbox.** The runtime manages Start and Reset
commands through a separate, runtime-internal `LifecycleCommand` channel that is
never part of the actor's `Mailboxes` tuple.

- `dispatch(LifecycleCommand::Start)` — dispatched by the runtime to exit Init and enter `initial_state()`
- `dispatch(LifecycleCommand::Reset)` — dispatched by the runtime to go **directly** to
  `initial_state()` (skipping Init entirely; no `on_init_entry`/`on_init_exit`)

Domain mailboxes contain only peer-to-peer messages. The domain run loop never
inspects `LifecycleCommand` values as domain events.

## Priority Semantics

The `Mailboxes` blanket impls poll streams in tuple index order: index 0 is polled
first on every call to `poll_next`. This means the stream at index 0 receives
priority over all others. Order streams by descending urgency.

## Supervised Run Loop

Supervised actors run the unified `run()` loop from `bloxide-core` with
`RunConfig::supervised(lifecycle_rx, supervisor_notify)`. The loop polls the
internal lifecycle channel **before** domain mailboxes. Domain events are only
polled when no lifecycle command is pending. The actor never sees lifecycle
commands as domain events.

```rust
// RunConfig variants (bloxide-core::runloop):
RunConfig::root()                                    // root supervisor/actor
RunConfig::supervised(lifecycle_rx, notify)          // supervised child
RunConfig::supervised_with_abort(lifecycle_rx, abort_rx, notify)  // + kill capability
RunConfig::unsupervised()                            // auto-start, exits on stop
RunConfig::bare()                                    // tests: no lifecycle, no auto-start
```

`RunConfig` is generic over `R: BloxRuntime`, so the lifecycle stream and notify
sender use the runtime's own channel types (`R::Stream`, `R::Sender`) — the same
signature serves Embassy, Tokio, and TestRuntime.

After every dispatch the runtime observes `DispatchOutcome` and sends
`ChildLifecycleEvent` to the supervisor's domain mailbox automatically.

`SupervisorSpec` itself uses a two-stream domain mailbox tuple:
- child lifecycle events (`Stream<ChildLifecycleEvent>`)
- supervisor control-plane events (`Stream<ChildCtrl<R>>`) for dynamic registration and watchdog ticks

## Wiring Pattern

Create one domain channel per message type, then build the mailbox tuple:

```rust
let ((ping_ref,), ping_mbox) = bloxide_embassy::channels! {
    PingPongMsg(16),
};
```

The `channels!` macro creates channels via `StaticChannelCap` and returns
`(refs_tuple, streams_tuple)` ready to pass to an actor task.

## Key Invariants

> **See `spec/README.md` → "Key Invariants" for the canonical list.**

Typed-mailbox-specific invariants:

- Domain `Mailboxes` tuples contain **no lifecycle stream** — lifecycle is runtime-internal.
- Callers only hold `ActorRef<M, R>` for the specific message type `M` they are
  authorized to send — they cannot send arbitrary `Event` variants.
- `NoMailboxes` is used as the `Mailboxes` type for spec impls driven directly via
  `machine.dispatch(event)` (e.g., in unit tests).
- The run loop exits on five conditions: `DispatchOutcome::Aborted`,
  `DispatchOutcome::Done`, all domain streams closed (all-streams-close),
  `DispatchOutcome::Stopped` when `exit_on_stop` is set, and
  `DispatchOutcome::Failed` when `exit_on_fail` is set. Supervised actors clear
  both flags, so their tasks stay alive through `Stopped` and `Failed` until
  the supervisor acts.
- An actor holding its own `self_ref` keeps its domain stream open — a
  convenience (e.g. for self-delivered timer messages), not a lifetime
  requirement. Shutdown flows through the lifecycle/abort streams and
  `Decision` outcomes, never through domain channel close.
