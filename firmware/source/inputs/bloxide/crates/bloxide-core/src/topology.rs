/// This trait is implemented by code generated from `blox.toml` by
/// `bloxide-codegen`. The `[topology]` section defines:
/// - `handler_fns` for the handler table macro
/// - `[[topology.states]]` entries with `name`, `composite = true`, and `parent` fields
///
/// After running `cargo blox generate`, the generated code provides:
/// - The state enum with `#[repr(u8)]`
/// - `impl StateTopology` with parent/leaf/path/index methods
/// - A handler table macro for `MachineSpec::HANDLER_TABLE`
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// - `parent()` forms a forest (no cycles). Every chain of `parent()` calls
///   must terminate at `None`.
/// - `path(self)` is root-first and ends with `self`.
/// - `as_index(self)` returns the declaration-order index (0..STATE_COUNT-1),
///   suitable for indexing `HANDLER_TABLE`.
/// - `STATE_COUNT` equals the total number of variants in the enum.

/// A newtype wrapper that can only be constructed for **leaf** states.
///
/// `Decision::Transition` takes `LeafState<S::State>`
/// instead of `S::State`, turning attempts to transition to a composite state
/// into a compile-time or debug-time error rather than silent UB.
///
/// `bloxide-codegen` auto-wraps state targets in `LeafState::new` when emitting
/// `StateRule` struct literals from `[[topology.transitions]]` entries, so
/// user-facing transition syntax is unchanged.
///
/// # Construction
///
/// - `LeafState::new(state)` — asserts `state.is_leaf()` in debug builds.
///   In release builds the assertion is elided but the wrapper still provides
///   a type-level guarantee when the macro generates it.
/// - `LeafState::new_unchecked(state)` — bypasses the assertion.
///   Use only when you have proven the state is a leaf via other means.
