//! Shared supervision reporting logic.
//!
//! [`report_outcome`] translates a [`DispatchOutcome`] into a
//! [`ChildLifecycleEvent`] and sends it to the supervisor's notify channel.
//! Both the Embassy and Tokio runtimes call this function — it is generic over
//! the runtime (`R: BloxRuntime`) so each runtime supplies its own sender type.

/// Translate a `DispatchOutcome` into the appropriate `ChildLifecycleEvent`
/// and send it to the supervisor via `notify`.
///
/// Supervision must never block the actor's run loop: a full channel drops
/// the event and logs a warning (genuine backpressure), while a closed
/// channel — the supervisor already exited, an expected shutdown race —
/// drops the event silently.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `S` — The actor's [`MachineSpec`]. Determines the state type carried by
///   the [`DispatchOutcome`].
/// * `R` — The [`BloxRuntime`], which determines the concrete sender type
///   (`R::Sender<ChildLifecycleEvent>`).
