/// Base trait for runtime-specific message sending and receiving.
///
/// This is the **only** trait that blox crates are generic over (`<R: BloxRuntime>`).
/// It abstracts the runtime-specific channel implementations while keeping
/// blox code runtime-agnostic.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// * `Sender<M>` — Send-side of a typed channel. Must be cheaply cloneable
///   (typically `Arc`-based) since `ActorRef<M>` clones it. The sender wraps
///   envelope metadata (sender ID) alongside the message payload.
/// * `Receiver<M>` — Receive-side of a typed channel. Converts to a `Stream<M>`
///   via [`to_stream`](Self::to_stream).
/// * `Stream<M>` — A fused stream that yields `Envelope<M>` values. The actor
///   run loop uses `futures::StreamExt::next` to await incoming messages.
/// * `SendError` — Error returned by [`send_via`](Self::send_via) when the
///   operation fails (e.g., channel closed). Most runtimes succeed unless
///   the receiver is dropped.
/// * `TrySendError` — Error returned specifically by [`try_send_via`](Self::try_send_via)
///   when a non-blocking send fails (channel full or closed — classify with
///   [`try_send_error_is_closed`](Self::try_send_error_is_closed)).
///
/// # When to Use Which Send Method
///
/// * **`send_via`** — Use when you want to wait for capacity (async). The sender
///   will await until space is available in the channel buffer. This is the
///   default choice for most actor-to-actor messaging.
/// * **`try_send_via`** — Use when you need non-blocking behavior. Returns
///   immediately with `Err(TrySendError)` if the channel is full. Useful for
///   implementing backpressure-aware protocols or bounded-mailbox actors.
///
/// # Converting Receivers to Streams
///
/// Use [`to_stream(receiver)`](Self::to_stream) to convert a `Receiver<M>` into a
/// `Stream<M>`. This is how the run loop receives messages via `futures::StreamExt::next`.
/// The stream yields `Envelope<M>` values containing both the message payload
/// and the sender's `ActorId`.
///
/// # Channel Creation
///
/// This trait does **not** include channel creation. See:
/// * [`StaticChannelCap`] — For compile-time-fixed capacity (Embassy, `no_std`)
/// * [`DynamicChannelCap`] — For runtime-configurable capacity (Tokio, `std`)
