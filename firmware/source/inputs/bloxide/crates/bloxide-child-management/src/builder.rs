//! Generic child group builder — creates channels and assembles a `ChildGroup`.
//!
//! This builder is generic over the runtime `R` and the control message type `Ctrl`.
//! The runtime provides group channels via `GroupChannelCap`; the app specifies
//! the control message type (e.g. `ChildCtrl<R>` if using the supervisor).
//!
//! Runtimes do NOT need to know about `ChildCtrl` — the app chooses `Ctrl`.

/// Builder for assembling a `ChildGroup` with group channels.
///
/// Generic over runtime `R` (must support `GroupChannelCap`) and control message
/// type `Ctrl` (chosen by the app — e.g. `ChildCtrl<R>`). One builder serves
/// every runtime: dynamic runtimes (Tokio, TestRuntime) create runtime-capacity
/// channels, static runtimes (Embassy) create const-capacity channels — so
/// generated wiring is identical across runtimes.
///
/// Channel capacities are const generics with defaults (notify 32, control 16,
/// per-child lifecycle 4). Generated wiring overrides them from the system.toml
/// `[supervision.capacities]` table, computing defaults from the child count —
/// the channels carry the supervision control plane, so they are sized to make
/// "full" a bug rather than routine backpressure (confirm-before-record still
/// handles Full correctly when it happens).
///
/// Created with `::new(shutdown, max_misses)`, children are added via
/// `add_child()`, and the group is consumed via `finish()`. `max_misses` is
/// the number of consecutive unanswered **delivered** health-check Pings
/// before a child is declared rogue and its `ChildPolicy` is applied — an
/// undelivered Ping (full channel) is never counted as a miss. Generated
/// wiring passes `2` by default (overridable via `[supervision.watchdog]`
/// `max_misses` in system.toml).
